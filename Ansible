Installing the Bare Metal Cloud Ansible module
This Ansible collection contains the server module which requires the Python requests HTTP library to work properly. If you don't have it installed on your machine already, run this command to install it:

pip install requests
Now install the Ansible collection by running:

ansible-galaxy collection install phoenixnap.bmc
You can view the server module documentation with this command:

ansible-doc phoenixnap.bmc.server
Authentication
You need to create a configuration file called config.yaml and save it in the user home directory. This file is used to authenticate access to your Bare Metal Cloud resources.

In your home directory, create a folder .pnap and a config.yaml file inside it.

This file needs to contain only two lines of code:

clientId: <enter your client id>
clientSecret: <enter your client secret>
To get the values for the clientId and clientSecret, follow these steps:

Log in to the Bare Metal Cloud portal.
On the left side menu, click on API Credentials.
Click the Create Credentials button.
Fill in the Name and Description fields, select the permissions scope and click Create.
In the table, click on Actions and select View Credentials from the dropdown.
Copy the values from the Client ID and Client Secret fields into your config.yaml file.
Example Ansible Playbooks for Bare Metal Cloud
Ansible Playbooks allow you to interact with your Bare Metal Cloud resources. You can create and delete servers as well as perform power actions with simple code instructions.

This example shows you how to deploy a Bare Metal Cloud server and delete it with Ansible Playbooks.

First, create a YAML file playbook_name.yml. The name part of the filename should contain the action you want to perform. To create a server, the filename can be playbook_create.yml.

Once you've created the file, open it and paste this code:

- name: Create new servers for account
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: false
  vars_files:
    - ~/.pnap/config.yaml
  collections:
    - phoenixnap.bmc
  tasks:
  - server:
      client_id: "{{clientId}}"
      client_secret: "{{clientSecret}}"
      hostnames: [my-server-red]
      location: PHX
      os: ubuntu/bionic
      type: s1.c1.medium
      state: present
      ssh_key: "{{ lookup('file', '~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub') }}"
To delete that same server, create a file called playbook_deprovision.yml and paste this code:

- name: reset servers
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: false
  vars_files:
    - ~/.pnap/config.yaml
  collections:
    - phoenixnap.bmc
  tasks:
  - server:
      client_id: "{{clientId}}"
      client_secret: "{{clientSecret}}"
      hostnames: [my-server-red]
      state: absent
Pay attention to the state item. This is where you tell Ansible which action you would like to perform. Here's a list of available options:

present: creates the server
absent: deletes the server
power-off: turns off the power supply to the machine
power-on: turns on the power supply to the machine
rebooted: restarts the server
reset: formats the server
shutdown: works on the operating system
